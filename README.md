Exploratory Data Analysis

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **CASIA-M2 dataset**, which is commonly used in facial expression and behavior analysis research.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:
- Visualize the dataset's class distribution
- Understand the diversity of subjects and expression types
- Analyze data availability across different categories

## 📁 Dataset Description

The CASIA-M2 dataset consists of multiple facial expression categories recorded under different conditions. The dataset contains labeled facial images or sequences categorized by expression, subject, and possibly modality.

## 🔍 What This Notebook Covers

- **Initial Setup:** Import required libraries and set up file paths.
- **Data Loading:** Parse and display directory structure or metadata.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Bar plots or pie charts showing class balance and subject distribution.
- **Missing or Skewed Data:** Identify potential gaps or imbalances in the dataset.

## 📈 Tools Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- OS / Pathlib for file traversal

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Download or mount the CASIA-M2 dataset in your working directory
2. Open the notebook `CASIA_m2-exploratory-data-analysis_Updated.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

## 🧠 Insights and Observations

This notebook will help uncover:
- Which classes are underrepresented
- Whether any subjects have more data than others
- Suggestions for preprocessing or balancing the dataset before training

## 📌 Requirements
Install required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
